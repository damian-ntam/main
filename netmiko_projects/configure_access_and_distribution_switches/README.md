We have 2 sets of switches. 
-----------------------------------------
1- Access Layer 
2- Distribution Layer

for access layer switches we prepare "iosv_l2_cisco_access.txt" configuration file.
for the distribution layer switches we prepare iosv_l2_distribution.txt


Basically we create 2 groups of commands list and apply respective group of devices.
